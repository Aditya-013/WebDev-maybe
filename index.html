            Sebastian Vettel; born 3 July 1987) is a 
            German racing driver who competes in Formula One for Aston Martin, having previously driven for BMW Sauber, Toro Rosso, 
            Red Bull and Ferrari. Vettel has won four World Drivers' Championship titles which he won consecutively from 2010 to 2013. 
            Vettel is the youngest World Champion in Formula 1. He also has the third most race victories (53) and podium finishes (122) 
            and the fourth most pole positions (57).<br><br>

            Vettel started his Formula One career as a test driver for BMW Sauber in 2006, making a one-off racing appearance in 2007. Part of the 
            Red Bull young-driver programme, Vettel appeared for Toro Rosso later that year and was kept as a full-time driver for 2008. Vettel was 
            promoted to Red Bull in 2009. With Red Bull, Vettel won four consecutive titles from 2010 to 2013, the first of which made him the sport's 
            youngest World Champion, setting the records for the most consecutive race wins (9) and race wins in a single season (13). Vettel signed 
            for Ferrari for 2015 and became Mercedes' and Lewis Hamilton's closest challenger in two title fights in 2017 and 2018, although he finished both 
            years as runner-up.

            2021: Aston Martin F1 Team
            
            Vettel at the 2021 British Grand Prix
            Vettel joined Aston Martin for the 2021 season, replacing Sergio Pérez.[196] In his debut race weekend in Bahrain, 
            he received a grid penalty in qualifying, forcing him to start last. While Vettel started well, he had a collision 
            with Esteban Ocon, giving him a time penalty and ended up finishing in 15th place. He received five penalty points on his 
            superlicence.[197] Aston Martin team principal Otmar Szafnauer reported no concerns, due to a very different car compared 
            to the Ferrari, lack of laps in pre-season testing and a very impressive race start.[198] In the fifth race of the season, 
            Vettel scored his first points for the team with a fifth place finish in Monaco.[199] At the following race, the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, 
            he claimed Aston Martin’s first podium with a second place finish.[200] Vettel also finished second in Hungary, but was later disqualified, 
            after his car failed to provide the one litre sample of fuel required.[201]
